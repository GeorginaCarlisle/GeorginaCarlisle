## About Me

Hi, I am Georgina Carlisle, a Software Engineer. I enjoy working with JavaScript, React.JS, Python, Django, CSS and HTML.

I work to a high level, utilising UX design and design thinking and ensuring a quality user experience that is accessible and responsive, as well as validated, well-organised code with comprehensive documentation. I love to work as part of a team, following Agile methodologies, getting to know my colleagues, and working out how I can best contribute. 

Pushing forwards at every opportunity, I love learning new skills as well as deepening my knowledge so that I can identify the best solutions. I have recently completed a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute, transitioning into software development from education and bringing with me experience and a real love of supporting, motivating and helping others to progress.

To get in touch, please connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgina-carlisle-617b58268/).

## My Portfolio Projects

### Take Control (Merit) - React and Django Rest Framework - March 2024

Take Control is a task management application that allows users to manage and organise multiple areas of their life.

<details>
<summary>Click here to learn more</summary>
 
Within Take Control users can create focus areas, set goals they wish to work towards and tasks that need to be completed. Users can then head to the "Take Action" page where all their tasks are displayed together in a backlog. Here tasks can be selected to work on today and checked as done once completed.

Take Control is a full-stack project with a separate React frontend and Django Rest Framework API.

<details>
<summary>Click here to learn more</summary>

This project was all about going full-stack and using Django to build an application with user authentication and plenty of CRUD functionality. I also took the decision to use Tailwind CSS for all the styling and followed Agile values and principles throughout.

### Case Closed (Merit) - Python - August 2023

Case Closed is a command line detective game where the player must follow the clues to work out who stole the missing item and where it is hidden.
<details>
<summary>Click here to learn more</summary>
 
The user takes on the role of a detective and has the chance to visit different locations, pick up clues and question the suspects to gain further information. Only by paying attention to the clues will they be able to work out who the thief is and where the stolen item is hidden.

Python and complex logic were used to create the program which uses an API to pull all the relevant clues and case information from a Google sheet. This has allowed multiple cases to be programmed each with multiple scenarios. Random number generation is then used to choose which storyline the user will be presented with. The program also passes the users choices back to the sheet, leaving a clear trail in case of errors and providing data which will inform future development.

### Wild Sliding Puzzles (Distinction) - HTML, CSS and JavaScript - July 2023

Wild Sliding Puzzles is a fun, enjoyable and addictive sliding puzzle game that promotes wildlife and wild landscapes in the British Isles and the work being done through the 'Save Our Wild Isles' project.
<details>
<summary>Click here to learn more</summary>
 
Users are faced with a scrambled image, by sliding the tiles around the grid and moving them to their correct position the picture is revealed. On completing the puzzle, users will be taken to a win page where they can learn more about the subject of the picture. The scope of the game has been further expanded by the inclusion of multiple puzzles, with the structure of the code allowing for easy inclusion of further puzzles. Session storage ensures that users receive a different puzzle when clicking play again and are informed once all available puzzles have been completed. 

Vanilla JavaScript combined with CSS were used to create the interactivity and movement of the puzzle pieces. Defensive design, careful logic choices and extensive testing ensure a bug free experience for users, with structure, styling, clear instructions, and user feedback coming together to provide a high user experience.
Wild Sliding Puzzles was created purely for educational purposes to showcase JavaScript in portfolio project two for the course 'Diploma in Full Stack Software Development' at Code Institute.
